            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ange Junior Gohouri, and I currently work as a Tester Quality Assurance at HUB2. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Earth Science from the University of ABIDJAN, and I have a strong passion for new technologies, which drives my commitment to ensuring the quality and functionality of software and systems.
                Originally from Gagnoa, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, I enjoy various hobbies such as reading, dancing, listening to music, and playing soccer. I am also an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I had the opportunity to serve a full-time mission in Nigeria (Calabar Mission).</p>

            <div><h2>Abidjan, Ivory Coast</h2>
                <p>Ivory Coast, or CÃ´te d'Ivoire, is a West African nation known for its rich culture, diverse landscapes, and economic importance as the worldâ€™s largest cocoa producer. With Yamoussoukro as its political capital and Abidjan as its economic hub, the country boasts vibrant music, art, and festivals, such as the Festival of Masks. Its attractions include Grand-Bassam, TaÃ¯ National Park, and the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. Home to over 27 million people, its population is ethnically and religiously diverse, with French as the official language. Gaining independence from France in 1960, the nation has grown despite challenges like environmental concerns and economic inequality, making it a fascinating blend of tradition and progress.</p></div>
